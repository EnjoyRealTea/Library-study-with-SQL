# ============================= Case Study 06 ================================
# ================== Library Management System with SQLite ===================
# ****************************** E. Thompson *********************************

"""
This version of the Library Management System case study uses SQLite3 to
manage a database containing the library's books, their members and records
of books borrowed and returned. To make it more realistic, the user can
opt to 'scan' in library cards and books when using the features.

Functions
---------
get_member:
    Obtains a valid member id from the user.
get_book:
    Obtains a valid ISBN from the user, and notes if the isbn is already used.
scan_all_books:
    Returns a random ISBN from all books in the library.
scan_from_shelf:
    Returns a random ISBN from all books in the library that are not on loan.
scan_from_user:
    Returns a random ISBN from books the member has on loan.
return_book:
    Records a book returning to the library.
borrow_book:
    Records a book being taken out of the library.
pay_fine:
    Allows a member's fines to be cleared.
reward:
    Records reward points, increases borrow limit when member has enough rewards.
fine:
    Records a fine and resets the member's rewards and borrow limit.
add_book:
    Adds a book to the library stock.
remove_book:
    Removes a book from the library stock.
add_member:
    Adds a new library member to the database.
user_id:
    Returns a random new or random existing member ID.
search_books:
    Allows the user to search for books by title or author.
print_book_record:
    Displays the record for a book.
print_all_books:
    Displays the records for all books.
print_loaned_books:
    Displays the records for books currently out on loan.
